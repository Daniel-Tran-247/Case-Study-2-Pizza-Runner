## üéØQuestions & Solutions
### ‚úîÔ∏èData Type Check
- Check data type of each column in ```customer_orders``` and ```runner_orders``` table to compare the changes after cleaning those tables. 

```sql
SELECT 
  table_name,
  column_name,
  data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'customer_orders';
```

<details>
  <summary>
    Result
  </summary>
  
| table_name      | column_name | data_type                   |
| --------------- | ----------- | --------------------------- |
| customer_orders | order_id    | integer                     |
| customer_orders | customer_id | integer                     |
| customer_orders | pizza_id    | integer                     |
| customer_orders | order_time  | timestamp without time zone |
| customer_orders | exclusions  | character varying           |
| customer_orders | extras      | character varying           |
 
</details>

```sql
SELECT 
  table_name,
  column_name,
  data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'runner_orders';
```

<details>
  <summary>
    Result
  </summary>
  
| table_name    | column_name  | data_type         |
| ------------- | ------------ | ----------------- |
| runner_orders | order_id     | integer           |
| runner_orders | runner_id    | integer           |
| runner_orders | pickup_time  | character varying |
| runner_orders | distance     | character varying |
| runner_orders | duration     | character varying |
| runner_orders | cancellation | character varying |
 
</details>

---> ```pickup_time``` is supposed to be ```timestamp```

---> ```distance``` and ```duration``` are supposed to be ```numeric```



### üßπData Cleaning 
- There are some missing values in ```customer_orders``` and ```runner_orders``` table that indicates either as ***blank strings ' '*** or as text ***'Null'*** instead of ```Null``` type. 
- The display of unit is not consitent across ```distance``` and ```duration``` column in ```runner_orders``` table.
- Incorrect data type in ```distance```, ```duration```, and ```pickup_time``` column in ```runner_orders``` table. 

---> ```customer_orders```: Creare a temporary table that replaces ***blank strings*** and ***Null (as text)*** with ```Null type``` 

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS customer_orders_cleaned;

CREATE TEMP TABLE customer_orders_cleaned AS (
  SELECT 
  	order_id,
  	customer_id,
  	pizza_id, 
  	CASE 
  		WHEN exclusions = '' THEN NULL
  		WHEN exclusions = 'null' THEN NULL
  		ELSE exclusions
  	END AS exclusions, 
  	CASE 
  		WHEN extras = '' THEN NULL
  		WHEN extras = 'null' THEN NULL
  		ELSE extras
  	END AS extras,
  	order_time
  FROM pizza_runner.customer_orders);

SELECT * FROM customer_orders_cleaned;
